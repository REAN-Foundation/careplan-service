# Careplan Service

Careplan service is meant for management of careplans.

This service supports following workflows.
- Author and edit careplan assets.
- Author careplan schedules.
- Register participants
- Enroll participants to one or more careplans

### Highlights
- API currently supports client authentication using API keys.
- User authentication is also applicable for careplan and asset creators and admin.

### Currently in progress
- Careplan service supports static careplan schedules, but support for dynamic scheduling of careplans is in progress. When complete, the scheduling will be driven by rule engine, events and participant responses.
- Assessments/quiz module is currently part of the REAN-care service. 
__SideNote: Assessment will be separate service which will seamlessly integrate with careplan service in the near future.__
